# Stacks and Queues

Using a Linked List as the underlying data storage mechanism, implement both a Stack and a Queue.

## Challenge

### Stack

- Create a Stack class that has a top property. It creates an empty Stack when instantiated.
  - This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to top when the stack is created.
  - The class should contain the following methods:
  - push
    - Arguments: value
    - adds a new node with that value to the top of the stack with an O(1) Time performance.
  - pop
    - Arguments: none
    - Returns: the value from node from the top of the stack
    - Removes the node from the top of the stack
    - Should raise exception when called on empty stack
  - peek
    - Arguments: none
    - Returns: Value of the node located at the top of the stack
    - Should raise exception when called on empty stack
  - is empty
    - Arguments: none
    - Returns: Boolean indicating whether or not the stack is empty.

### Queue

- Create a Queue class that has a front property. It creates an empty Queue when instantiated.
  - This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to front when the queue is created.
  - The class should contain the following methods:
  - enqueue
    - Arguments: value
    - adds a new node with that value to the back of the queue with an O(1) Time performance.
  - dequeue
    - Arguments: none
    - Returns: the value from node from the front of the queue
    - Removes the node from the front of the queue
    - Should raise exception when called on empty queue
  - peek
    - Arguments: none
    - Returns: Value of the node located at the front of the queue
    - Should raise exception when called on empty stack
  - is empty
    - Arguments: none
    - Returns: Boolean indicating whether or not the queue is empty

## Approach & Efficiency

### Approach

Approach was testing first to support debugging of methods.

### Efficiency

- Big O Time: O(1); same amount of time will be used for adding and removing, no matter the length of the data structure
- Big O Space: O(1); same amount of space will be used for adding and removing, no matter the length of the data structure
